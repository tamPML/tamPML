## About Me
- 🛠️ Just an engineer trying to make sense of code (mostly Googling for solutions)
- 🐾 Spends an inordinate amount of time trying to make sure my two dogs don't kill themselves
- 🎨 I do code and I do art. Jack of both trades makes me a master of none 😶
- 🌟 Don't try to connect with me because I am just as clueless as you are

  kthx bye (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
